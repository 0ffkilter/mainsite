The ASPC Digital Media and Programming Group collects the information \r\nresources of the college and put them to work for you, the student.\r\n\r\nWe use industry-standard tools such as HTML5, CSS3, Python, Django, and jQuery \r\nto develop services for the student body, the Senate, student organizations, \r\nand ASPC Retail and Food Services.\r\n\r\n### For example, in the last year we have launched: ###\r\n\r\n  - a new design for ASPC's main web presence, with a new CMS to back it up\r\n  - a database of [all the rooms on campus](http://aspc.pomona.edu/housing/) with reviews\r\n  - a new secure provisioning system for club and student organization \r\n    websites\r\n  - a redesigned version of the Our Pomona [course schedule builder](http://aspc.pomona.edu/courses/schedule/) for the 5C \r\n    catalog\r\n  - [SageBooks](http://aspc.pomona.edu/sagebooks/), a way for Pomona students to sell their old textbooks and buy \r\n    used ones from their fellow students\r\n  - a searchable [list of local businesses](http://aspc.pomona.edu/eatshop/businesses/) with student discounts\r\n  - a totally redesigned [Coop Store website](http://coopstore.pomona.edu/) built around Shopify\r\n\r\nWhy you should join us\r\n================================\r\n\r\nWe build things we want to use. Every time you've wished something were \r\navailable online or easier to find, that's something we can improve.\r\n\r\nWe do things the way 'real' web developers do. Skills honed here will be \r\nuseful to you whether you end up at a web startup or as a \r\nprofessor that wants to post their course materials online.\r\n\r\nHow you can apply\r\n================================\r\n\r\nCheck out our code on [GitHub](http://github.com/aspc) and see if it strikes your fancy. Then contact [digitalmedia@aspc.pomona.edu](mailto:digitalmedia@aspc.pomona.edu)  and tell us about your experience with web technologies and programming in general. If you don't have any experience with web technologies, you can still help.

The Elections Supervisor shall be appointed by the Senate at the beginning of each semester, and shall supervise ASPC elections according to the rules and procedures specified in the ASPC Constitution, Bylaws, Elections Code, and rulings of the Senate.  \r\nb. The Elections Supervisor shall be assisted in all their duties by an Elections Committee, and appointed in accordance with the ASPC Bylaws.  \r\nc. When the ASPC conducts elections for other organizations, they shall be in accordance with the rules of that organization and, when applicable, of this Elections Code.  \r\nd. The Elections Supervisor shall schedule the dates, times, and locations of all elections and shall schedule nominations periods, campaign periods and meeting for all speeches.  \r\ne. The Elections Supervisor shall publicize all pertinent information.  In the absence of an Elections Supervisor, the current ASPC President will assume this role.  \r\nf. Before the election period, the Elections Supervisor and the Senate shall jointly establish guidelines for the conduct of the elections, attempting to clarify all foreseen ambiguities in the Code.  \r\ng.\tDuring the elections period, the Elections Supervisor and the ASPC President shall have authority over the conduct of ASPC elections.  All decisions made by the Election Supervisor and ASPC President may be appealed to the Executive Council and Senior and Junior class presidents and ruled on during the elections period.    \r\nh. After the election period, the Elections Supervisor shall submit to the Senate a summary all preparations made, unofficial disputes and resolutions, and recommendations for changes to the election procedures.  \r\n\r\nSection II: Eligibility\r\n\r\na. All registered students of Pomona College shall be members of the Associated Students of Pomona College and shall be eligible to vote and hold office.  A candidate must meet the requirements of the office they seek, as specified in the ASPC Constitution.  Students who are not currently registered but have previously enrolled at Pomona College and intend to enroll for a full year may seek office in the spring elections.  \r\nb. Any candidate who violates any section of this code shall be subject to disqualification by the Elections Supervisor, subject to the approval of the Senate.  \r\nc.  Residents of North Campus may not vote for South Campus Representative.  Residents of South Campus may not vote for North Campus Representative.  Students residing off campus are not eligible to vote for North or South Campus Representatives.  \r\n\r\nSection III: Candidates\r\n\r\na. The Elections Supervisor shall post the rules governing the election in public view at the filing place for candidacy.  \r\nb. Each candidate must file their intention to seek office on an ASPC form during the nomination period.  The nomination form shall include the following statement: \"If I am elected to the office that I am seeking, I intent to serve the entire term unless I am subsequently elected to another ASPC position.  I will not apply to any semester away programs and will withdraw any applications I have previously submitted.\"  \r\nc. Each candidate must be aware of all rules governing the election, and each is responsible for their actions.  \r\nd. No candidate may run for more than one office in a single election.  \r\n\r\nSection IV: Campaign \r\n\r\n\"Campaigning\" shall herein be defined as promoting oneself as a candidate in the election.\r\n\r\na. The campaign period shall begin as soon as a candidate has filed for office and becomes aware of the rules and regulations governing the election by attending a pre-election candidate meeting.  If the candidate cannot attend this meeting, they must contact the Elections Supervisor within 24 hours of the candidate meeting. The candidate may not begin to campaign before meeting with the Elections Supervisor.  \r\nb. The campaign period extends though the election; however, candidates are not allowed to address voters while they are voting and cannot campaign in the dining halls during the election. All candidates must remove their campaign materials by midnight of the day that their final election results are announced.  \r\nc. Campaign materials must conform to the rules of the premises and the ASPC Publicity Guidelines.  Mailboxes may not be stuffed unless each item is individually addressed.  \r\nd. All election materials posted by or for any candidate for ASPC office shall legibly specify the date, time, and location of the candidates' forum and the election.  Any given forum need only be mentioned by candidates for the office(s) represented in that forum.  Materials posted after the forum may omit the information on the forum, but must include information on the election.  \r\ne. The Elections Supervisor or elections committee members may confiscate any materials in violation of this code.  Any flagrant violation would render the candidate subject to disqualification.  \r\nf. The Student Life shall accept campaign statements (150 words maximum) and photos from each candidate for any one office between the beginning of the filing period and the pre-election candidate meeting.  Statements and photos shall be printed together in the candidates\u2019 section.  \r\ng. No more than $15 shall be spent for half-campus campaigns for senators and $20 spent for full campus campaigns regardless of the source.  An additional $5 may be spent on run-off campaigns.  No candidate\u2019s campaign shall receive financial support from any club or organization that receives ASPC funding. Candidates are encouraged to use alternative advertising methods and be aware of the environmental impact of their campaign. For environmental reasons, and because in the past flyers have remained up for weeks after elections results were announced, candidates may not use mass-copied flyers for their campaigns. However, candidates may still use posters made in the ASPC poster lab.  \r\nh. All candidates must turn in a list of expenditures, both purchased by the candidate or donated to the candidate, to the Elections Supervisor by 5pm on the day of the election results. All receipts must be attached to this list. After presenting their receipts, candidates will be reimbursed for their campaign expenses by ASPC.  \r\ni. Candidates may send one \u201cStudent Information\u201d email via the Smith Campus Center office, and the email must contain information about their campaign.  In the case of a run-off, candidates may send one additional \u201cStudent Information\u201d email.  \u201cChirps\u201d messages of any kind are not permitted by candidates or others on behalf of the candidates.  \r\nj. Candidates who utilize social networking websites (Facebook, MySpace, etc.) must be the sole administrator of a campaign group or event. It is the responsibility of the candidate to ensure that only one such group is created for their campaign. All candidates must notify the Elections Supervisor of the creation of such a group as well as other forms of online campaigning (e.g. blogs).  \r\nk. Candidates' Forum  \r\n    1. The Elections Supervisor shall hold at least one forum for all interested candidates and voters. They may also hold forums for all interested candidates for a particular office.  The time and place for all such meeting(s) shall be designated at least one week in advance by the Elections Supervisor and announced at the pre-election candidate meeting. Candidates are expected, but not required to participate in the forum.  \r\n    2. Candidates are encouraged to publicize and host unofficial forums.  Any candidate who wishes to hold a forum must obtain prior approval from the Elections Supervisor.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSection V: Elections\r\n\r\na. Ballots  \r\n1. Internet ballots shall be prepared by the Elections Supervisor and the ASPC Webmaster.  \r\n2. Ballots shall list all candidates by office, with spaces for write-ins.  \r\n3. Offices shall clearly be designated as North Campus, South Campus or Off-campus when applicable.  \r\n4. The order in which names are listed on the ballot shall be alphabetical, and no additional designations (e.g. race, gender, or class) shall be included.    \r\n5. Candidates will be listed on the ballot as their full legal name unless otherwise indicated \u2013 requests for name changes must be approved by the Elections Committee.  \r\n\r\nb. Polling  \r\n1. The polling shall be carried out by the Elections Supervisor.  \r\n2. Each voter may cast one ballot for each eligible position. In order for a ballot to be valid, it must have a first preference listed.  \r\n3. Polling shall be conducted online, over the course of a 24-hour period beginning at 9:00 PM and ending at 9:00 PM on the following day.  \r\n4. The Elections Supervisor shall ensure that there is a functional computer available in both Frank and Frary.  In a run-off, the Elections Supervisor may choose to set up a computer in a single dining hall at their discretion if the position(s) contested applies to only a certain portion of the student body. These computers shall serve as voting stations during lunch and dinner.  They shall be available and staffed for the entirety of each meal.  \r\n5. There shall be no proxy voting.    \r\n6. Students participating in a Pomona study-abroad program, a non-Pomona study-abroad program approved by the Office of Study Abroad, or in a Pomona-approved domestic exchange program shall be contacted via email to inform them of their right to vote in campus-wide and class-specific ASPC elections (e.g. Senior Class President) at least six days prior to elections.    \r\nc. Winning  \r\nIf a candidate receives the majority of first-preference votes, they will be elected.  If no candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, instant runoff (IRV) shall proceed in rounds until a single candidate receives the majority.  In IRV, the candidate with the least first-preference votes is eliminated in each round, and those ballots are redistributed to the next highest preference listed. Each ballot shall be counted as one vote for the continuing candidate listed as the highest preference in each round. If a tie still occurs after IRV, run-off elections shall proceed as indicated in Section VI.  \r\n\r\nSection VI: Election Results  \r\n\r\na. Votes shall be counted and results determined according to the above rules, and this shall be done by the Elections Supervisor and Committee.  The Elections Supervisor shall notify each candidate of the results of their race by phone or in person immediately upon the completion of counting.  At that time the candidate may request the tabulated results of the election in which they ran.  \r\nb. Run-offs shall be held on the first or second or third weekday right after the preceding election.  Weekday nights are defined as Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights. The Elections Supervisor may hold a meeting for run-off candidates on the evening after initial results are announced.   \r\nc.  Candidates shall be allowed to campaign from the time after the election results from the prior election are posted until online run-off voting begins.  \r\nd. Complaints may be filed by any candidate on grounds of a violation of the elections rules, a miscount of ballots, or any other questionable practice, provided that the candidate is directly involved in the complaint.   \r\ne. Complaints must be submitted in writing to the Elections Supervisor during the campaign period up until 24 hours after posting the results.  \r\nf. The Elections Supervisor shall rule on all complaints within 48 hours of receiving them and notify the Senate of all actions.  \r\ng. Candidates may appeal decisions of the Elections Supervisor to the Senate.  All disqualifications are automatically appealed.  Appeals must be submitted in writing to the ASPC President within 24 hours of receipt of the ruling of the Elections Supervisor.  The Senate shall rule on the appeal, by majority vote, within 48 hours of receipt of the appeal.  \r\n\r\nSection VII:  Write-In Candidates  \r\na.  A write-in candidate must meet all of the eligibility requirements of the office. Write-in candidates must conform to all areas of the Elections Code in the same way as an official candidate.   \r\nb.  To be a write-in candidate, a student must notify the Elections Supervisor of their intent to run as a write-in candidate by 11:59pm on the day before the election. Only write-in candidates who have notified the Elections Supervisor will have votes counted in the election.   \r\nc.  Write-in candidates may not submit a candidate statement or picture to The Student Life, may not speak at the candidates\u2019 forum, may not send a \u201cStudent Information\u201d email via the Office of the Dean of Students, and may not be listed on the ballot.  \r\nd.  Any write-in candidate who qualifies for a run-off election will be considered an official balloted candidate for the run-off election.  \r\ne. In any election, a write-in candidate must receive at least ten ballot preferences to be eligible to win.  \r\nf. Ballots will include spaces for the number of write-in candidates that have notified the Elections Supervisor pursuant to Section VII, subsection b.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevised 9/98  \r\nRevised 11/99  \r\nRevised 10/10/00  \r\nRevised 04/23/02  \r\nRevised 10/13/02  \r\nRevised 3/22/05  \r\nRevised 11/11/05  \r\nRevised 11/20/06  \r\nRevised March 2007  \r\nRevised May 2010  \r\nRevised September 6, 2010  \r\nRevised September 12, 2011  \r\nRevised September 27, 2011  ", "managed": false, "parent": 2, "title": "Elections Code", "short_title": "", "summary": "The Elections Code governs the way elections are carried out by ASPC for student government positions.", "visible": true, "stylesheet": "", "sort_order": 3, "slug": "elections-code"}, "model": "folio.page", "pk": 30}, {"fields": {"body": "Documents and reports produced by the student government and various Pomona College committees are archived here for posterity.\r\n", "managed": true, "parent": 1, "title": "Senate Document Archive", "short_title": "Document Archive", "summary": "Documents and reports produced by the student government and various Pomona College committees are archived here for posterity.\r\n", "visible": true, "stylesheet": "", "sort_order": 10, "slug": "documents"}, "model": "folio.page", "pk": 31}, {"fields": {"body": "<img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACgAAAAoCAYAAACM%2FrhtAAAAGXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBBZG9iZSBJbWFnZVJlYWR5ccllPAAAAQpJREFUeNrsmNENgjAQhlvDADzrEowALiJuoJM4AkwijOAS%2BswG%2BJMUQwrFypUG8P7kcuGA9AOudy3ycH%2FVwkLP414Kh7IddycWLgbcPGBgiFewx8xjl9pxBAv1i6RhNpWYtYnPNwWOAi7mHPw7QBZr1ULtimC3gXgIyxpPHUNS4OAKVf1zFPZzC6fikepGCc5VXgE1uFY57NqBa0WClI7guj18KD4ZckqhPhkgxEi8eaiLz0%2BcwaU%2F3PLJUZ%2BTxBZyMhwJ0BKSBEcG%2FAJJhnMCaIB0Aue6qzSdo1awi219qWCxNibeF%2FO%2BeKk52Pt55DonVc7pa8beejIYWXjGM7%2BcmHOQAdcA%2BBZgAHeqamzorgRQAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" style=\"margin: 2em auto; display: block; max-width: 100%;\" alt=\"TurboVote Logo\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https://pomona.turbovote.org\">Register for ballot forms and reminders</a></h2>\r\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center\">Make sure your friends vote in the national election!<br>Share the link: <a href=\"https://pomona.turbovote.org\">pomona.turbovote.org</a></h4>\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Students office and Associated Students of Pomona College have partnered with a non-partisan organization that makes absentee voting as easy as mailing back a Netflix DVD.
