						<h3>Those Guys In That Band (live!)</h3>
						<p class="location">Listen on KSPC 88.7</p>
						<p class="description">Those Guys In That Band have returned to Claremont to play a live on-air set for the college radio station that gave them their first ever play in regular rotation. Sometimes called "a cross between Massive Attack and Raffi", or "dancehall punk polka", their music really does defy genre classification. Tune in on KSPC 88.7 fm to hear them, and be sure to check out their <a href="">page on bandcamp</a>.</p>
